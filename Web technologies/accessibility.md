### What are web accessibility best practices?
Web accessibility ensures that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them.

- Proper Use of HTML Semantics: Use correct HTML elements for their intended purpose. For instance, use <button> for a button instead of a div with a click event. This will help screen reader users understand the content better.
- Organize Content with Headings: Headings structure your content making it easier for screen readers to navigate. Always use them in order.
- Alternative Text for Images: Always include alt text for images, so that users with visual impairments can understand what the image is about. And if the image is purely decorative and doesnâ€™t provide any information, it should still have an alt attribute, but the attribute should be empty (alt="").
- Label All Form Elements: Unlabeled form elements are one of the biggest barriers for screen reader users. Associate all form inputs with labels to make forms accessible.
- Use ARIA Roles Where Necessary: ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles can provide additional context to screen reader users where HTML semantics aren't enough.
- Responsive Design: The website should be accessible on all devices, desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones, regardless of screen size.
- Keyboard Accessibility: Ensure your website can be navigated using only the keyboard. All interactive elements must be reachable and operable using keyboard keys.
- Adequate Contrast: The color of text and its background needs to have enough contrast so that people with moderate vision loss can read the content.
- Avoid CAPTCHA where possible. If CAPTCHA really needs to be included, ensure that it is simple to understand and includes alternatives for users with disabilities, such as providing more than two ways to solve the CAPTCHAs and disabling it for users who have logged in.
