### Customer asked to implement some solution, but you understood that the solution isn't optimal and there are better ways to implement it, what would you do as a team lead to convince a customer?
* Ask about a reason of choosing the suboptimal approach. Maybe you don't see the whole picture, maybe a customer has mistakenly chosen a wrong solution.
* Highlight the risk of implementing the proposed solution. Explain possible consequences of implementing it. Create a table with comparison of several solutions, comparing them by pros and cons, risks, limitations, etc. Ask some authority to whom a customer might believe to compare proposed solutions (it can be someone from client's side, SA, DM, PM etc.).
* Implement POC if resources and time allows.
* If a proposed solution is really risky, it makes sense to discuss it with management of your company (PM, DM) to make it clear to everyone around, and in order to not gain possible reputational losses to the company in the future.

### There is a project that must be delivered at some particular date, 2 months before the deadline you understand that you won't be able to deliver it, what will you do and how to explain it to a client?
* First, delivery should be divided into sequence of steps, and if using available metrics (velocity/capacity) you realize that the last step cannot get in time or if some proposed functionality from the customer side wasn't delivered in time - the information about potential missing a deadline should be known earlier.
* Let customer (+ DM, PM, etc.) know about the missing deadline as soon as possible, explaining the reasons.
* Discuss possible ways to deal with the missing deadline. Possible solutions: delay delivery of a project, reduce its scope, add resources (avoid hiring if possible, ideally expand a team with people from neighboring teams), discuss overtimes (if a customer is ready to pay and a team is ready to contribute).
* If the project is underestimated - discuss it with management. There can be changes in a contract with the client, further costs related discussions, etc.

### What to do if a customer dissatisfied with performance of the team?
* To increase transparency, provide a customer updates about the work done, repeat discussed decisions in letters to have proofs of agreements and check that everything was understood correctly.
* Use available KPI / metrics / graphics to show a customer performance from previous intervals. Explain that it would be incorrect to compare different teams by number of closed story points.
* To increase quality of scrum processes.
* Avoid hidden overtimes when part of the team tries to close their tasks after working hours, which gives the customer the feeling that this is a normal pace that will continue in the future.
* To manage accurately capacity from people in shadow mode, potentially it can vary from sprint to sprint.

### What to do if a customer comes to you and says that he is not satisfied with performance of one of team members and asks to replace this person?
* Ask about a reason of dissatisfaction and explain costs of replacing a team member to the customer (time to hire a new person, KT, delay in delivery of new functionality, etc.), in addition the result of replacing a person is still unpredictable.
* Analyze a situation, check metrics (number of story points delivered, etc.) of this person, ask for feedback from his colleagues.
* Discuss a situation with a person in supportive way, there can be temporary personal issues because of which a person couldn't concentrate on tasks, but after some time or a short vacation productivity can be restored.
* It also might be mutual dissatisfaction, a person will gladly change a project, and it will be the cheapest option to replace a person.

### What to do if two teammates have problems communicating with each other?
* Try to understand a reason of the problem. Discuss it privately with each person, try to find a way to improve communication between them.
* Informal calls where people discuss unrelated to work things might help to break the ice.
* Try to isolate conflicting people by assigning independent tasks to them.
* Involve RM / HR.
* If nothing helps - separate them, move to different teams / projects.

### How to sell to a customer some functionality (e.g. solution / process / cloud vendor / unit tests)?
* To explain why it's needed trying to focus on non-technical benefits to business.

### What to do if right before demo you noticed that some functionality does not work as expected?
* Try to be clear, explain why it does not work and when it will be fixed.
* If it's know that some underlying service is unstable, prepare screenshots / records of the screen in advance.
* If there are no working parts to show - postpone the demo.

### How to build trusting relationship with a customer?
* Be always clear and transparent.
* Turn on camera during online calls, don't skip small talks, introduce informal calls together if everyone agrees, if possible, meet a customer in real life (business trip).
* Try to solve customer's problems right away without redirecting to other people in order to show importance of customer questions and your readiness to work on these problems.
* Be aware of customer's culture, for someone it can be normal to keep distance, hide emotions, be very specific at requirements or vice versa provide very high level requirements; someone could be very polite, someone is straightforward, etc.

### How to prepare to a business trip?
* Usually there is a list of questions that should be discussed in a business trip, you should be ready to discuss them, brush up required technical / project knowledge.
* Prepare questions you want to discuss with a customer.
* Be active, try to contribute to any discussions in which you participate.

### How to deal with unhappy customers?
* Collect information about the reason of dissatisfaction as much as possible.
* Keep calm, be polite and friendly, stay involved in the conversation, listen actively.
* Provide a solution / have a plan of actions / prepare follow-ups.
* Don't promise things impossible to resolve / deliver.

### How to manage dependency on a third-party team?
* Explain to a customer that delivery of your piece of functionality depends on the assumption that external team will deliver their piece.
* Create a plan of delivery, track progress of each step.
* Arrange periodical sync-ups with this team to be updated with their progress.
* Keep a customer informed.
* Don't be afraid to escalate a problem, possible prioritization on the customer side can help.

### Why we want to work with happy customers?
* Because customers bring a company revenue.
* If communication is good, a customer can improve relationship with a company, start new projects, offer new positions, etc.

### Why do we need to manage risks?
It's not always possible to prevent risk, but it's wise to have a plan of actions and be prepared for risky situations.

Examples of risks:
* Third-party teams or possibility of appearing a new team, integration with a new team
* Staffing
* Specific technologies on the project
* Bus factor
