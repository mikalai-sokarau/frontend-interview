### RAIL
RAIL is an acronym that stands for Response, Animation, Idle, and Load. It is a user-centric performance model developed by Google to help web developers build fast and responsive web applications. The RAIL model breaks down the user's experience into four categories and provides guidance for optimizing each one to create a smooth and responsive user experience.

* Response: This refers to the time it takes for a user interface to respond to a user input, such as clicking a button or typing in a field. The goal is to respond within 100 milliseconds or less.
* Animation: This refers to the smoothness and fluidity of the animations in the user interface. The goal is to achieve a consistent 60 frames per second (fps) animation.
* Idle: This refers to the amount of time when the user interface is idle and not responding to user input. The goal is to use this idle time to perform non-critical background tasks, such as pre-fetching data, optimizing images, or updating the cache.
* Load: This refers to the time it takes to load the web application and its resources. The goal is to load the critical content within 1 second or less on a 3G connection.

### SOLID
SOLID is an acronym that represents a set of principles for writing good object-oriented code.

* Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning that it should have only one responsibility.
* Open/Closed Principle: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to add new functionality to a system without modifying the existing code.
* Liskov Substitution Principle: Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types. This means that any instance of a base class should be able to be replaced by an instance of a derived class without affecting the correctness of the program.
* Interface Segregation Principle: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This means that interfaces should be as small and specific as possible.
* Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. This means that you should depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, and that you should avoid creating tightly coupled code.

### FIRST
F - Fast: unit tests should be fast to run
I - Isolated/Independent: unit tests should be independent and not reliant on external factors such as a database or network connection
R - Repeatable: unit tests should be repeatable and consistent in their results
S - Self-Validating: unit tests should have a clear pass/fail criteria and provide immediate feedback
T - Timely/Thorough: unit tests should be written in a timely manner, ideally before the code they are testing. Should cover every use case scenario and NOT just aim for 100% coverage.

### ACID
A set of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably.
* Atomicity: A transaction is an atomic unit of work, which means it either executes completely or not at all. If any part of a transaction fails, the entire transaction fails and the database remains unchanged.
* Consistency: A transaction ensures that the database remains in a consistent state before and after the transaction is executed. If a transaction violates any rules or constraints, it is rolled back to the previous consistent state.
* Isolation: Transactions are executed in isolation from one another, which means that the intermediate states of a transaction are not visible to other transactions. This ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with one another.
* Durability: Once a transaction is committed, the changes made to the database are permanent and will survive any subsequent system failures, including power outages and crashes.

### STAR
It is a method of answering behavioral interview questions.
* Situation: Begin by describing the situation you were in. This could be a challenge you faced, a project you worked on, or any other context that's relevant to the question.
* Task: Describe the task or goal you were trying to achieve in the given situation.
* Action: Explain the specific actions you took to address the situation or accomplish the task. This is where you want to highlight your skills and experience.
* Result: Finally, describe the outcome of your actions. What did you accomplish? What did you learn? Be sure to focus on measurable results whenever possible.

By using the STAR interview technique, you can provide detailed, specific answers that demonstrate your skills and experience in a way that's relevant to the job you're applying for.
