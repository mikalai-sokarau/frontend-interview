### What is leadership?
Leadership is the ability of a person to drive the team, motivate people, lead them in the right direction, and create an atmosphere where everyone is happy to work in.

### What is delegation?
Task delegation is the process of assigning a specific task or responsibility to another person or team member. This involves entrusting the authority and accountability for the task to another person while still retaining overall responsibility for the outcome.

### What is assignment?
Assignment is simply giving someone a task to complete, without giving them any additional decision-making authority or control. The person completing the assignment is expected to follow established procedures and report back to the manager on the results.

### What tasks can be delegated?
1. A low priority task, which is something that doesn’t come under your core focus area.
2. Less important tasks that eat away at your time and/or energy.
3. Laying the groundwork such as collecting resources, prospect research, data entry, etc.
4. Tasks that you are not good at doing.
5. A task that your teammates can do better.
6. Something that you want your team to learn.

### What tasks cannot be delegated?
* Strategic decision-making: Decisions that impact the overall direction and strategy of a project or organization.
* Technical expertise: Tasks that require specialized technical knowledge or expertise, such as writing complex code or debugging a challenging issue
* Legal and ethical responsibilities: Tasks that require specific legal or ethical considerations, such as managing data privacy and security.
* Final review: Final review of the completed project or code is usually not delegated to ensure quality and compliance with established standards and processes.

It's important to note that these tasks may still be shared among team members, but the ultimate responsibility for their completion cannot be fully delegated. The extent of delegation also depends on the individual project, company culture, and the level of trust and expertise of the team members.

### Why do we need to delegate tasks?
> The first rule of management is delegation. Don’t try and do everything yourself because you can’t.

Delegating tasks is important for several reasons:
* Builds trust: Delegating tasks can help build trust between managers and team members by demonstrating that the manager trusts them to handle responsibility.
* Saves time: By delegating tasks, managers can free up their own time to focus on more important tasks and strategic initiatives.
* Enhances motivation: Team members are often more motivated and engaged when they are given responsibility and the opportunity to take ownership of tasks.
* Avoiding becoming a bottleneck in development or decision-making.

### How to delegate a task properly?
1. Choose the right person: When delegating a task, it is important to choose the right person for the job. Consider the individual's skills, experience, and workload to ensure that they have the capacity to take on the task.
2. Define the task: Clearly define the task and its objectives, including any specific outcomes or deadlines. Be sure to communicate your expectations clearly and provide any necessary guidance or resources.
3. Provide authority: Delegate the necessary authority to complete the task, such as decision-making power or access to resources.
4. Set checkpoints: Establish regular checkpoints or milestones to monitor progress and ensure that the task is on track.
5. Provide feedback and support: Provide regular feedback and support to the individual as needed. Be available to answer questions, provide guidance, and offer support as necessary.
6. Hold accountability: Hold the individual accountable for the task and its outcomes, while providing recognition and rewards for successful completion.
7. Evaluate the results: Once the task is complete, evaluate the results and provide feedback to the individual. Identify any areas for improvement or opportunities for future growth.

### What are main benefits of delegation?
* Free up time for solving critical issues
* Grow new leaders within the team, increase chances to take a bigger role.

### How do frontend and backend developers communicate when developing an application?
1. Regular Meetings: Frontend and backend developers should have regular meetings, such as stand-ups, sprint planning, or retrospectives, to align on project goals, discuss progress, and address any blockers or challenges. These meetings promote open communication and collaboration.
2. Clear Project Requirements: The frontend and backend teams should have a shared understanding of the project requirements. This includes the features, functionality, user interface, and data requirements. Clear and detailed specifications or user stories help both teams stay on the same page.
3. API Documentation: Backend developers should provide comprehensive and up-to-date API documentation to frontend developers. The documentation should outline the available endpoints, request/response formats, authentication mechanisms, and any additional guidelines or constraints. This enables frontend developers to understand how to interact with the backend services effectively.
4. API Contract Definition: The frontend and backend teams can collaborate on defining an API contract, which specifies the expected data structures and formats exchanged between the frontend and backend. This contract ensures that both teams understand the data requirements, reducing the chances of miscommunication or inconsistencies.
5. Mocking or Stubs: In the early stages of development, when the backend APIs might not be fully implemented or available, backend developers can provide mocked or stubbed endpoints to simulate the expected behavior. This allows frontend developers to work independently and develop the user interface using representative data.
6. Communication Channels: Frontend and backend developers should establish efficient communication channels, such as email, instant messaging, project management tools, or dedicated communication platforms like Slack or Microsoft Teams. These channels enable real-time communication, quick feedback, and addressing any implementation or integration issues promptly.
7. Bug Tracking and Issue Management: Using a bug tracking or issue management system like JIRA or Trello allows frontend and backend developers to report and track issues, assign tasks, and communicate about bug fixes or feature enhancements. This helps streamline communication and ensures that issues are addressed in a coordinated manner.

### What are the contract-first and code-first approaches in application development?
1. Contract-First Approach: In the contract-first approach, developers start by creating a detailed plan, or "contract," that defines how different parts of the application will work together. This plan includes specifications for the data formats, communication protocols, and expected behaviors of the different components of the application.
Once the contract is finalized, frontend and backend developers can work independently, building their respective parts of the application based on the agreed-upon specifications. They can ensure their code aligns with the contract, ensuring compatibility and smooth integration when it's time to put everything together.
2. Code-First Approach: On the other hand, the code-first approach is like starting to build the treehouse right away without a detailed plan.
In this approach, developers dive into writing code and developing individual components of the application without a predefined contract. They focus on getting things up and running quickly based on their understanding of the requirements.

In professional application development, both approaches are used depending on the project's requirements and the team's preferences. The choice between contract-first and code-first approaches depends on factors like project complexity, timeline, collaboration needs, and the level of certainty about the requirements.
