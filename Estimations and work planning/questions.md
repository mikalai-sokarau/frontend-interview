### What is estimations?
Estimation is a technique allowing to calculate how much money, effort, resources, and time it will take to build a specific system or product, it helps to plan and coordinate product releases, facilitate communication and synchronize work with other teams.

### What are benefits of using storypoints for estimation?
1. Quickly estimate issues. Estimation is relative to already completed Product Backlog Items. This is faster than estimating without any reference.
2. Estimate without giving a specific time commitment. When estimating in hours, you make a precise time commitment. Estimating in Story Points prevents giving an exact commitment. Nobody knows exactly how many hours you are appointing to a specific issue.
3. Embrace the uncertainty that comes with estimation. Story Points specify an unknown time range. Selecting from a specific Fibonacci-like sequence of Story Points allows you to capture uncertainty. Uncertainty is captured in the Fibonacci-like sequence because as the number becomes bigger, the steps between numbers also become bigger.
4. Accurate enough to plan sprints ahead. This allows you to better manage the time expectations of stakeholders for future work. 

### Why do we estimate only a visible part of work?
1. It doesn't make sence to estimate work that unknown. Estimating only a visible part of work allows you to save resources.
2. It makes you more flexible and ready to urgent changes, it allows to quickly adapt to changing requiremets.

### What technics of estimations do you know? (Bottom-top/top-bottom, best/worst case scenario)
1. Expert Judgment. This project estimation approach implies the use of specialists’ expertise to make forecasts.
2. Comparative / Analogous Estimation. Refers to the comparison of upcoming projects with data on the progress and results of previously delivered similar projects. The method works best for typical projects with similar work scopes. It is often used at the early stages in the project life cycle to get a ballpark estimate of how much resources would be required.
3. Parametric Estimation. Useful when a new project is similar to the previous one in terms of size, complexity, and other relevant parameters. However, parametric estimation can be less accurate when the project is significantly different from past projects, or when there is a lack of historical data.
4. Top-down Estimation. This method starts with a high-level view of the project, and then breaks it down into smaller, more detailed estimates. It can be useful when a project has a high level of uncertainty and the team doesn't have enough information to estimate the work accurately.
5. Bottom-up Estimation. Method of project estimation that starts with detailed estimates of the individual tasks or components of a project, and then aggregates these estimates to arrive at an overall estimate for the project. This approach is often used when the scope of a project is well defined and when detailed information about the project is available.
6. Three-point Estimation. Method that uses the formula: (Optimistic Estimate + Pessimistic Estimate + [4 × Most Likely Estimate]) / 6

### What are story points, difference with estimation in hours.
Storypoints are a relative and estimation in hours is an absolute measure of effort. Storypoints are more flexible but less accurate and predictible than estimation in hours.

### What estimation techniques do you know?
Planning Poker - estimation in some kind of fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, ...)\
T-Shirt Sizes - estimation in sizes of T-shirt (s, m, l, xl, ...)\
Bucket System - grouping items by placing them in “buckets”, used to estimate large number of items.

### How to sell story points to a customer?
Highlight its benefits: faster estimation, increased flexibility, improved predictability, ...

### How to avoid story points inflation?
Story points inflation could happen if a team doesn't track velocity / historical data, doesn't have a pivot table, when a team is working under pressure, when understanding of a task is different betweeen team members.

### Is it correct comparing 2 different teams by completed story points?
No, every team has different capacity/velocity and pivot table.
 
### What is better under/over estimation?
It's better to over estimate because a customer could have commitment with client to deliver functionality in time. It's more safe to finish promised work early than to reschedute deadlines. 

### Approaches to estimate unknown work?
Spike/POC/MVP/Experts opinion/Decompose a task to smaller pieces.

### What to do if you failed estimations, how to explain it to the customer?
It's needed to inform a customer about the risk of missing a deadline as soon as it's possible, be transparent about the reasons of the delay, discuss the impact of the missing deadline and possibilities to decrease the impact, offer a possible solution (reduce the scope of work, expand a team, move terms, overtimes (if a customer ready to pay and a team ready to work)) and take actions.

### How to choose between different estimation technics?
If a large amount of work should be estimated in a short term, it's better to estimate it in T-shirts or using a top-down or bucket technique.
Low-level estimation in storypoints / hours / bottom-up easier to use when tasks are small and well-understood.
Experts estimation can be used in all cases.
Mixed approaches can be used when first project is estimated using top-down technique, than divided functionality is estimated using storypoints.

### What to do if a customer every sprint wants to add new stories to the sprint scope?
Discuss consequences of this request (some tasks should be replaced, current work won't be delivered, work in progress will be conservated and stopped, developers need to switch context, other teams will suffer, ...)
Show metrics from the normal sprint, compare it with the sprint that was interrupted.
Switch to kanban if it's easier to everyone.

### What if a customer asks to extend a scope of the work taken for a year?
Discuss with a delivery manager allocation of additional resources (extend a team with juniors/hire new people/borrow developers from a neighbor stream), discuss overtimes if everyone agrees on it
