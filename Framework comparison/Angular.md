### What is Angular?
Angular is a framework developed by Google. It is based on TypeScript. It has own routing, two-way Data Binding, use Dependency Injection, RxJS and so on.

Pros:
* Angular is a complete solution, it has own routing, SSR, modular system and so on.
* Large ecosystem: Angular has a large and active community, with a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries, tools, and resources, making it easier to build complex applications.
* Native TypeScript and RxJS integration.
* Built-in CLI that provides a set of commands for creating, building, and managing Angular projects.

Cons:
* Steeper learning curve: Angular has a steeper learning curve compared to some other front-end frameworks due to its comprehensive and complex features, especially for developers who are new to TypeScript or have limited experience with front-end frameworks.
* Overhead: Angular may have some overhead in terms of setup and configuration due to its extensive features and tools, which may require additional effort for initial setup and project configuration.
* Flexibility: Angular may have less flexibility compared to React and Vue, as it follows a more prescriptive approach to building applications, which may not be suitable for all projects or development teams with specific requirements.

### How does Angular work?
Angular is based on the concept of zones, which are a set of hooks that intercept and capture asynchronous operations such as promises, timers, and events. Angular uses a mechanism called "change detection" to detect changes in the application's state and update the view accordingly. Angular also uses a declarative approach to building UI components using templates, which are a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
