### What is React?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows to create reusable UI components that update automatically in response to changes in data. React follows a component-based architecture, where the user interface is built as a tree of components, making it easy to manage.

Pros:
* Flexibility: React is a library, not a framework like Angular or Vue, which means it offers more flexibility in terms of how you structure and manage your application.
* Large ecosystem: React has a large and active community, with a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries, tools, and resources. This provides developers with a wide range of options and solutions for common tasks, such as state management, routing, and UI styling, making it easier to build complex applications.
* Learning curve: React has a relatively low learning curve compared to Angular and Vue.
* Good documentation.
* Backward Compatibility.
* Can be used for mobile development.

Cons:
* Manual configuration and integration of additional libraries for required functionality (routing, SSR, state management, i18n).
* JSX Syntax: React uses JSX (JavaScript XML) syntax, which may require developers to learn a new syntax and understand how it works.

### How does React work?
React uses a virtual DOM to keep track of changes in the UI components. It uses a process called "reconciliation" which is an algorithm that compares the current tree of components with the new tree of components and determines what needs to be updated or changed in browser's DOM. React components have lifecycle methods or hooks that allow developers to connect to different stages of a component's life, such as component creation, updates, and destruction.

### What is the difference between class components and functional components in React?
Class components are traditional React components that use class syntax and have access to lifecycle methods. They can have their own state and are typically used for more complex components. On the other hand, functional components are simpler and do not have their own state. They are written as JavaScript functions and are typically used for presentational or stateless components. Functional components can also use hooks to manage state and side effects.

### What is Redux and how does it work?
Redux has three main parts: the store, actions, and reducers. The store is a single object that contains the application state. Actions are objects that describe what happened in the application. Reducers are functions that take the current state and an action as arguments, and return a new state based on the action type.

There are three principles of Redux:
* Single source of truth: The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.
* State is read-only: The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.
* Changes are made with pure functions: To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.

### What is Virtual DOM and how does it work?
Virtual DOM is a JavaScript object that represents the DOM. It is a lightweight representation of the DOM tree, which is used to keep track of changes in React components. React uses a process called "reconciliation" which is an algorithm that compares the current tree of components with the new tree of components and determines what needs to be updated or changed in browser's DOM. This process makes it faster and more efficient to update the UI, especially when dealing with frequent changes.
