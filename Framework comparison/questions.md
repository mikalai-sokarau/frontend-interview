### How to choose a technology stack for a new front-end project?
1. Define Project Requirements: Clearly define the requirements of your project, including the expected functionalities, performance, scalability and timeline. Consider factors such as the size and complexity of the project, target audience, business goals and possible integrations.
2. Define existing customer's ecosystem.
3. Consider team expertise, think about newcomers, documentation, knowledge transfer.
4. Consider cost and time of adopting a new technology stack, including the potential costs of training, onboarding, and migration, as well as the estimated time required for development, testing, and deployment.
5. Define project specifics such as the complexity of the UI (SPA or multi-page), the need for server-side rendering, the availability of existing APIs, and integration requirements with other technologies or systems.

### How can we stay updated with the latest versions of libraries and dependencies?
* Regularly check for updates.
* Set up auto-notifications for new versions.
* Create tickets to update dependencies on a regular basis.
