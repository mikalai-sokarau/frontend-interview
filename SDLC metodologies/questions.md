### What is software development lifecycle?
Software development lifecycle (SDLC) is a process used by software development teams to design, develop, test, and deploy high-quality software. It includes a series of stages that software goes through from conception to retirement, and involves a combination of activities, such as planning, designing, coding, testing, and maintaining software. The purpose of SDLC is to ensure that software is developed efficiently, meets the requirements of stakeholders, and is of high quality

### How many stages SDLC has?
1. Project Planning.
2. Gathering Requirements & Analysis.
3. Design.
4. Coding or Implementation.
5. Testing.
6. Deployment.
7. Maintenance.

### What is Scrum?
Scrum is an Agile framework for managing and completing complex projects. It is a lightweight, iterative and incremental process that emphasizes on delivering value to the customer. Scrum methodology focuses on delivering small pieces of working software within short iterations, called Sprints, which typically last 1-4 weeks. The Scrum framework consists of three main roles: the Product Owner, the Scrum Master, and the Development Team. The Product Owner is responsible for prioritizing and managing the product backlog, which is a list of all features, enhancements, and bug fixes required for the product. The Scrum Master is responsible for facilitating the Scrum process and removing any impediments that may prevent the Development Team from achieving their goals. The Development Team is responsible for designing, developing, testing and delivering the product incrementally during each Sprint. Scrum methodology also includes various ceremonies, such as Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-up, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, which help to ensure transparency, collaboration, and continuous improvement throughout the project.

### Pros and cons of Scrum:
Pros:
* Transparency and visibility into the project progress
* Flexibility to adapt to changing requirements
* High level of collaboration and communication between team members
* Focus on delivering business value and customer satisfaction
* Faster time-to-market with each iteration
* Continuous improvement and learning through retrospectives
* Efficient use of resources and budget

Cons:
* Can be difficult for new teams or teams without proper training
* Requires active participation and involvement from all team members
* Can lead to burnout and overwork if sprints are not properly planned and executed
* Lack of a clear roadmap can make it difficult for stakeholders to understand project progress
* Can be challenging to manage dependencies between sprints
* Can be difficult to measure individual performance and accountability

### What is waterfall?
It is a linear and sequential approach to software development, where each phase of development is completed before the next one begins. Once a phase is completed, it is difficult to make changes in the preceding phases, making this methodology less flexible than Agile methodologies.

### Pros and cons of waterfall:
Pros:
* It provides a clear structure and approach to software development.
* Each phase is completed before moving on to the next, which reduces the risk of errors or oversights.
* It works well for small projects with well-defined requirements.
* It is easy to understand and implement.

Cons:
* It is inflexible and can be difficult to accommodate changes or feedback during the development process.
* It can be time-consuming and costly to fix errors or issues that arise during later stages of development.
* It does not allow for customer feedback or testing until the later stages of development, which can lead to unanticipated problems.
* It can be difficult to accurately estimate the time and resources required for each phase.

### What is Kanban?
Kanban is a visual management tool used to implement agile and lean software development methodologies. It is not a specific software development lifecycle methodology, but rather a framework that can be applied to different methodologies such as Scrum, Lean, and Agile. Kanban emphasizes continuous delivery and improvement by using visual cues to manage work in progress and limit work items in various stages of the development process. The methodology is based on the concept of "pull" rather than "push", which means that work is pulled through the development process by the team as they are ready for it, rather than pushed into the process by management or a fixed schedule.

### Pros and cons of Kanban:
Pros:
* Flexibility: Kanban is highly adaptable to changes and allows teams to respond quickly to shifting priorities and requirements.
* Continuous Improvement: The focus on continuous improvement and optimization of workflow can lead to increased efficiency and productivity over time.
* Visual Management: The visual nature of Kanban boards helps team members easily see the status of work items, identify bottlenecks, and collaborate effectively.
* Reduced Waste: Kanban emphasizes limiting work in progress, reducing overproduction, and minimizing unnecessary waiting time, which can result in reduced waste and increased efficiency.

Cons:
* Lack of Structure: Kanban can be less structured compared to other methodologies like Scrum, which may be challenging for some teams to follow.
* Lack of Time-Boxing: Kanban doesn't have set sprint or iteration lengths, which can lead to work items being in progress for longer periods, potentially delaying delivery.
* Reliance on Team Self-Management: Kanban relies heavily on team members being proactive in managing their own workload and workflow, which can be challenging if team members lack discipline or are not self-motivated.
* Limited Planning: Kanban doesn't provide as much structure for planning as other methodologies, which may make it difficult to forecast delivery dates or manage dependencies.

### Core Kanban principles?
* Visualize the workflow: This involves creating a visual representation of the workflow to help everyone involved understand the process.
* Limit work in progress (WIP): This principle focuses on limiting the amount of work that is in progress at any given time to reduce the chance of bottlenecks and improve flow.
* Manage flow: This involves monitoring the flow of work through the system and making adjustments to ensure that work is moving efficiently.
* Make process policies explicit: Clearly define and communicate the policies and procedures that govern the workflow, including prioritization, how work is pulled through the system, and quality standards.
* Implement feedback loops: Establish regular feedback loops to continuously monitor and improve the process.
* Improve collaboratively and evolve experimentally: Encourage continuous improvement by constantly seeking out and experimenting with new ideas and techniques, and promoting a culture of collaboration and innovation.

### What are the main metrics used in Kanban?
* Lead Time: The time it takes to deliver a completed task to a customer from the time it was requested.
* Cycle Time: The time it takes to complete a task from start to finish.
* Throughput: The number of work items completed per unit of time (e.g. per day, per week).
* Work in Progress (WIP): The number of tasks that are currently being worked on by the team.
* Blocked Tasks: The number of tasks that are stuck due to dependencies or other reasons.
* Escaped defects: The number of defects found in the work items after they have been delivered to the customer.
* Burn-up and Burn-down charts: A graphical representation of the progress of work over time.

### What is definition of ready?
It's the list of requirements that need to be met before a developer can start working on a task in a project.

### What is definition of done?
It's a set of criteria that must be met before a task can be considered complete. In software development, this includes things like completing all requirements, passing unit tests, code reviews, successful builds, and deployment to production environment.

### What roles exist in Scrum?
* Scrum Master, who is responsible for driving meetings and ensuring previous agreements about processes are observed.
* Product Owner, who leads the project.
* Development Team, which includes developers, testers, designers, and DevOps.

### How many ceremonies exist in Scrum?
* Sprint Planning. The purpose of Sprint Planning is to plan the work to be done during the sprint. 
* Daily Scrum or Stand-up. It is a short meeting that takes place every day during a sprint in Scrum. The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to provide an opportunity for the Development Team to synchronize their work and plan for the day ahead. Typically, team members answer three questions: What did I do yesterday? What will I do today? Are there any obstacles in my way?
* Sprint Review. It takes place at the end of each sprint where the Scrum Team, stakeholders, and customers come together to inspect and review the product increment produced during the sprint.
During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team presents the completed work to the stakeholders and customers, demonstrating the new features and functionalities that have been added to the product increment. The stakeholders and customers provide feedback and ask questions, and the Scrum Team collaborates with them to ensure that everyone has a shared understanding of the work that was completed during the sprint.
* Sprint Retrospective. During the Retrospective, the team reflects on the previous Sprint and identifies areas where they can improve. The goal is to find ways to work more effectively as a team and to continuously improve the quality of their work. The Sprint Retrospective follows a structured agenda that includes reviewing the previous Sprint, identifying what went well and what didn't, and discussing ways to improve.

### What are the main artifacts in Scrum:
1. Product Backlog - A prioritized list of features or items that need to be delivered for the project.
2. Sprint Backlog - A subset of the Product Backlog, containing the items that the development team commits to delivering in a specific Sprint.
3. Increment - The sum of all Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints. It represents the work that has been completed and is potentially shippable.

### What is Agile?
It's a methodology that used to deliver products in an iterative and incremental approach. It involves a set of values and principles outlined in the Agile Manifesto:
* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan
"That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more."

Principles behind the Agile Manifesto:
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
Agile processes promote sustainable development.
8. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.
