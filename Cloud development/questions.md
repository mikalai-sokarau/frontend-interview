### What is cloud development?
It's a process of building and deploying software applications that run on cloud-based infrastructure, rather than on local servers or personal computers. This involves using cloud computing platforms, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP), to develop, test, and deploy applications.

### Pros and cons of cloud development?
Pros:
1. Scalability: Cloud infrastructure allows developers to easily scale up or down their resources as needed, which can be especially useful for applications that experience spikes in traffic.
2. Cost savings: Cloud infrastructure eliminates the need for companies to invest in and maintain their own physical servers, which can lead to cost savings.
3. Accessibility: Cloud-based tools and resources can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection, which can increase collaboration and productivity.
4. Security: Cloud providers often have more resources and expertise to devote to security than individual companies, which can lead to improved security.
5. Flexibility: Cloud development allows developers to use a variety of programming languages, tools, and frameworks, which can increase flexibility and innovation.

Cons:
1. Dependence on third-party providers: Companies that rely on cloud providers for their infrastructure are dependent on the reliability and security of those providers.
2. Potential downtime: Cloud infrastructure can experience downtime, which can lead to decreased productivity and lost revenue.
3. Limited control: Companies may have limited control over their infrastructure and may be subject to the policies and limitations of their cloud provider.
4. Data security concerns: Storing data on cloud servers can raise concerns about privacy and data security.
5. Complexity: Cloud development can be more complex than traditional development, requiring specialized knowledge and skills.

### Pros and cons of on premise development?
Pros:
1. Control: Companies have full control over their infrastructure, including security, resources, and software upgrades.
2. Security: With on-premise development, companies have complete control over their security measures, which can be customized and tailored to their specific needs.
3. Compliance: Companies that operate in highly regulated industries may find it easier to maintain compliance with on-premise development, as they have more control over their infrastructure and can more easily demonstrate their compliance.
4. Reliability: On-premise development can be more reliable than cloud-based solutions, as it is not dependent on third-party providers or internet connectivity.
5. Customization: Companies can customize their infrastructure and development environments to their specific needs, without having to rely on preconfigured cloud solutions.

Cons:
1. Cost: On-premise development can be more expensive than cloud-based solutions, as companies must purchase and maintain their own hardware and software infrastructure.
2. Scalability: Companies may face limitations in scaling their infrastructure with on-premise development, as it may be difficult to quickly acquire and set up new servers and hardware.
3. Accessibility: On-premise development can be less accessible than cloud-based solutions, as it requires physical access to servers and hardware.
4. Time-consuming: On-premise development can be time-consuming, as it requires a significant amount of setup and maintenance.
5. Limited collaboration: On-premise development may limit collaboration among teams, as development environments may not be easily accessible to all team members.

### What does serverless development mean?
Serverless development is a cloud computing model in which the cloud provider manages the infrastructure required to run an application, including the servers and operating systems, and customers only pay for the time their code runs.

### What primary categories of cloud computing services exist?
1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): This is the most basic level of cloud computing service provided by AWS. It involves renting out virtualized computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networking, to customers who can then deploy and manage their own operating systems, applications, and other software on top of the infrastructure. Examples of AWS IaaS offerings include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), and Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS).

2. Platform as a Service (PaaS): This level of cloud computing service builds upon the infrastructure provided by IaaS and offers a more complete development and deployment environment for software applications. With PaaS, customers can focus on building and deploying their applications without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure. Examples of AWS PaaS offerings include AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda, and AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS).

3. Software as a Service (SaaS): This is the highest level of cloud computing service provided by AWS, and involves delivering software applications over the internet as a fully managed service. With SaaS, customers can access and use software applications without having to install or maintain any software on their own devices. Examples of AWS SaaS offerings include Amazon WorkSpaces, Amazon Chime, and Amazon QuickSight.

### What does infrastructure as a code mean?
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a concept allowing to define and manage infrastructure resources through code, using high-level programming languages or configuration files, which can be version controlled, tested, and deployed like any other software code.

### What tools can be used for logging, alerting and monitoring in cloud?
1. AWS CloudWatch / GCP Stackdriver / Azure monitor for collecting logs.
2. AWS X-ray for tracing.
3. Grafana / NewRelic for visualization, real-time monitoring and alerting.
4. Splunk / ELK for searching and analyzing.
5. PagerDuty for notifications.

### Pros and cons of using VPC?
Pros:
1. Enhanced Security: VPC provides a high level of security by allowing users to create isolated networks that are not accessible from the public internet. It also provides features such as network ACLs (access control lists) and security groups to control traffic flow.
2. Customizable Networking: VPC allows users to customize their network configuration, including IP address ranges, subnets, and routing tables, to suit their specific needs.
3. Easy to Scale: VPC can be easily scaled up or down to meet changing business needs. Users can add or remove resources, such as EC2 instances, without affecting other resources in the network.

Cons:
1. Complex Setup: Setting up VPC can be complex, especially for users who are not familiar with networking concepts. Users need to have a good understanding of IP addressing, routing, and network security to create a functional VPC.
2. Requires Maintenance: VPC requires ongoing maintenance to ensure that it is functioning properly. This includes monitoring network traffic, managing security groups, and updating routing tables.
3. Difficult to Troubleshoot: Troubleshooting network issues in VPC can be difficult, especially for users who are not familiar with networking concepts. Users need to have a good understanding of network troubleshooting tools and techniques to resolve issues.
